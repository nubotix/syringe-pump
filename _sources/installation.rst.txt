After you have received your Cavro Centris syringe pump, follow instruction on how to set it up. After it is all set-up, secured and configured to work according to the manufacturer, connect it to the computer. Depending on the configuration of your syringe pump you might need RS-232 to USB adapter.

After the syringe pump is configured ensure it is visible by your operational system.
